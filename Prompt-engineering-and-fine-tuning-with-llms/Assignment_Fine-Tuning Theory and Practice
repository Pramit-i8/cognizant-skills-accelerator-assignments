Part 1: Theory of Fine-Tuning

1. What is the main benefit of fine-tuning an LLM?

It customizes the model for specific tasks or domains.


2. Which of the following describes "catastrophic forgetting"?

Answer: When the model loses its generalization ability after excessive fine-tuning on a specific task.



Application Task
Explanation of Transfer Learning Using a Real-World Analogy:

Transfer learning is similar to how a person might leverage knowledge from a general field to perform a specialized job. For example, imagine someone who has been trained as a general mechanic. This person has a broad understanding of vehicle repair, but they want to specialize in repairing high-end sports cars. Instead of learning everything from scratch, they transfer their general knowledge and then fine-tune it by learning about the specific parts and technologies used in sports cars.

Similarly, in machine learning, a model trained on a vast dataset learns general patterns. Transfer learning allows the model to apply this knowledge to a new, related task by fine-tuning it with a smaller, specialized dataset. For instance, in healthcare, a model trained on a large corpus of medical texts can be fine-tuned with a dataset containing specific types of medical records (e.g., diagnosing heart disease), allowing the model to perform well on this specialized task.

Hands-On Coding Task: Fine-Tuning the DistilBERT Model

1. Environment Setup:

bash
Copy
!pip install transformers datasets torch
!pip install -U sentencepiece  # For certain tokenizers
To verify GPU availability (if you are using a GPU):

python
Copy
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True if GPU is available
2. Preprocessing Data:

Load the IMDB dataset and preprocess it for tokenization:

python
Copy
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer

# Load IMDB dataset
dataset = load_dataset('imdb')

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], padding='max_length', truncation=True)

# Apply tokenization
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Print tokenized dataset sample
print(tokenized_datasets['train'][0])
3. Model Training:

Define the training arguments and fine-tune the model using Hugging Face's Trainer API:

python
Copy
from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained model for sequence classification
model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",     # evaluation frequency
    learning_rate=2e-5,              # learning rate
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,   # batch size for training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,    # batch size for evaluation
    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs
    weight_decay=0.01,               # strength of weight decay
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         # the pre-trained model
    args=training_args,                  # training arguments
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],  # training dataset
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test'],   # evaluation dataset
)

# Start training
trainer.train()
4. Save and Evaluate:

After training, you can save the model and evaluate its performance:

python
Copy
# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_distilbert")

# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
eval_result = trainer.evaluate()
print(eval_result)
